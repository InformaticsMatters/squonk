# in a Released state. Note: it is the user's responsibility
# to protect themselves for data loss here. This will inspect the

# What volume type are we using? One of: -
#
# - dynamic
# - nfs
# - none
#
#   When using `dynamic' remember to set
#   the accompanying 'volume_storage_class' variable (see below)
#
#   When using 'nfs' you must have provisioned the NFS volumes
#
#   When set to 'none' the user is expected to have provisioned
#   the persistent volumes and claims suitable for the project.
